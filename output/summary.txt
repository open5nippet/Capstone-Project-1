KEY INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Consumption Variability: The standard deviation across buildings is 
   significant, indicating opportunities for energy efficiency improvements.

2. Peak Hour Management: Focus on reducing peak-hour consumption through:
   - Demand-side management programs
   - Peak load shifting initiatives
   - Equipment efficiency upgrades

3. Building Comparisons: Dormitory consumes 
   152.4% more energy than Library.
   Investigate operational differences for best practices sharing.

4. Weekly Patterns: Weekday vs. weekend consumption patterns show clear 
   variations. Implement occupancy-based control systems.

5. Efficiency Targets: Setting a 10-15% reduction target across all 
   buildings could save 1,115.83 kWh annually.
